Fonts look a little blurry / fuzzy. Reduced the Apple Font Smoothing to 1 (if I choose 0, the fonts are thinner and more fuzzy). | The colors looks to me OK even with YPbPr- the contrast is overall a little bit less I think. Switch to RGB with HDMI with help of the QGeem Hub: I can't see any major difference in color- the contrast is better I think. |
